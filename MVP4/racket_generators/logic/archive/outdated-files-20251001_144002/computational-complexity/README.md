# Computational Complexity Port

## Scope
This port provides domain-specific operations for computational complexity theory within the CLEAN v10 framework.

## Key Features
- **Complexity Classes**: P, NP, PSPACE, EXP classification
- **Church-Turing Equivalence**: Unified Church, Turing, and Feynman computation
- **Algorithmic Guarantees**: Totality, normalization termination, cost bounds
- **Strict Mode**: Refuses classification unless invariants are met
- **Certificates**: Structural conditions logging for complexity classification
- **Î” Monotonicity**: Constructive proxy for program soundness
