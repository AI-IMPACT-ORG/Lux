# Lambda Calculus Port

## Scope
This port provides domain-specific operations for λ-calculus computation within the CLEAN v10 framework.

## Key Features
- **Lambda Terms**: Variable binding, abstraction, and application
- **Beta Reduction**: Function application and evaluation
- **Alpha Conversion**: Variable renaming and substitution
- **Normal Forms**: Weak and strong normalization
- **Church Encoding**: Natural numbers, booleans, and data structures

## Mathematical Foundation
- Implements pure λ-calculus semantics
- Supports typed and untyped variants
- Provides computational models for functional programming
- Integrates with the framework's phase/scale semantics

## Use Cases
- Functional programming language semantics
- Computability theory and recursion
- Type theory and proof assistants
- Program transformation and optimization

## Integration
This port seamlessly integrates with the CLEAN v10 framework's:
- Normal form computation
- Boundary sum properties
- Renormalization flow
- Observer invisibility principles
