# Boolean Logic Port

## Scope
This port provides domain-specific operations for Boolean logic and RAM-based computation within the CLEAN v10 framework.

## Key Features
- **Boolean Operations**: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR operations
- **RAM Simulation**: Memory access patterns and computational models
- **Logical Evaluation**: Truth table generation and logical inference
- **Circuit Analysis**: Boolean circuit representation and analysis

## Mathematical Foundation
- Implements classical Boolean algebra
- Provides computational models for digital logic
- Supports formal verification of logical circuits
- Integrates with the framework's phase/scale semantics

## Use Cases
- Digital circuit design and verification
- Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem analysis
- Logical reasoning systems
- Computer architecture modeling

## Integration
This port seamlessly integrates with the CLEAN v10 framework's:
- Normal form computation
- Boundary sum properties
- Renormalization flow
- Observer invisibility principles
