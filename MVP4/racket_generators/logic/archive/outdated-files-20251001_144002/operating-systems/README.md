# Operating Systems Port

## Scope
This port provides domain-specific operations for operating system concepts and kernel functionality within the CLEAN v10 framework.

## Key Features
- **System Calls**: Complete Linux system call interface (100+ syscalls)
- **Process Management**: Process creation, PID management, program execution
- **Memory Management**: Virtual memory, paging, allocation, alignment
- **Device Access**: Hardware abstraction, device drivers, I/O operations
- **Network Operations**: Socket creation, TCP/IP stack, networking
- **File Operations**: File system access, permissions, operations
- **Security Checks**: Access control, user/group permissions, capabilities
- **Interrupt Handling**: Hardware interrupts, exceptions, context switching
- **Kernel Subsystems**: Scheduler, memory manager, device manager, etc.

## Mathematical Foundation
- Implements operating system concepts
- Provides kernel functionality modeling
- Supports system call analysis
- Integrates with the framework's phase/scale semantics

## Use Cases
- Operating system design and analysis
- Kernel functionality modeling
- System call verification
- Operating system research

## Integration
This port seamlessly integrates with the CLEAN v10 framework's:
- Normal form computation
- Boundary sum properties
- Renormalization flow
- Observer invisibility principles
