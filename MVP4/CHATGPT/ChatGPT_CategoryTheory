I want to design a racket implementation of this that is best practice TYPED racket. Use the typing system to the max - this is key. Pay attention to the nested types, universe levels, dependencies and so on. we will likely need a 3x3x3 type of typing "cube" is a feeling I have. Actually, this may already be quite redundant. One of these 3 is exactly the M3, M2, M1 type of pyramid. What is new here is that there is ALSO a M1,M2,M3 "inverted" type pyramid, and the two are interrelated.

Thought for 4m 35s
Love this challenge. I’ll sketch a Typed Racket design that treats the “3×3×3 cube” you’re feeling—while keeping the two pyramids (M3→M2→M1 and its inverted M1→M2→M3) explicit and interrelated in the types. I’ll also be very upfront where Typed Racket can’t offer true dependent types and how we emulate them safely with phantom indices, singletons, and parametric structs.

I’m (mildly) unsure about your exact semantics and operators at each level; so below I provide a rigorous type-first scaffolding that you can fill with your domain logic. It compiles in spirit (modulo your Racket version), uses idiomatic struct:/All/phantom parameters, and forces the right kind of cross-level wiring by the type checker.

Design sketch (short)
Axis A (Abstraction level): M3, M2, M1 (the “standard” pyramid).

Axis B (Aspect / Institution view): Sig (signatures/metaschema), Sen (sentences/constraints), Mod (models/instances).

Axis C (Directionality): TopDown vs BottomUp (the “inverted” pyramid). We encode direction through typed transformation pairs (refine vs abstract) and require level-correctness in their types.

Typed Racket can’t do full dependent types/universes, but we emulate them via:

Phantom type parameters that index every artifact by its level (M3/M2/M1) and aspect (Sig/Sen/Mod) so ill-typed cross-level moves don’t compile.

Singletons & newtype tags to make the indices real to the type checker.

Quantification with All to write generic algorithms that still preserve indices.

Encapsulated invariants: satisfaction ⊨ is typed so you can only ask (Mod L) to satisfy (Sen L) over the same signature level L. Lifting/lowering functions are level-specific and stitched as adjoint-like pairs.

Why this satisfies the “cube” & dual pyramids
Level safety: Every artifact and transformation is indexed by a phantom L; the type checker forbids mixing levels.

Aspect separation: Sig, Sen, Mod are distinct parametric families—mirrors the (Sig, Sen, Mod, ⊨) shape from institution theory.

Two pyramids, interrelated: We provide top-down “refine” and bottom-up “abstract” maps on all three aspects, and you can codify their adjoint-like laws as equational properties/tests. Because types encode the direction and level, you can’t accidentally compose the wrong way.

3×3×3 “cube”: Cross of {M3,M2,M1} × {Sig,Sen,Mod} × {TopDown/BottomUp}; we manifest the third axis by paired functions that inhabit the two directions at each (level × aspect) cell.

Extending to “max typing”
If you want to push further:

Singleton-enforced levels
You can add smart constructors that demand concrete singletons and hide raw struct makers behind modules, ensuring only your factories can produce SigM2, etc.

Typed logic of sentences
Replace the toy Formula with a typed AST (e.g., sorted terms, arities checked statically by tagging predicates with phantom arity indices). Where Typed Racket can’t express the dependency at the type level, encode it in the value and guard with typed smart constructors.

Generic protocols
Use define-generics to give each aspect a protocol interface (compose, rename, pullback, …) and implement per level. The generic method signatures can themselves be universally quantified over L.

Proof obligations as typed tests
State the cube laws (inflation/deflation, preservation of satisfaction under reindexing, etc.) as parametric properties with All (L) and run them in CI.

Run it (csh)
#!/bin/csh
# Save your module as mde-cube.rkt, then:
raco make mde-cube.rkt
racket -t mde-cube.rkt
Honest caveat
Typed Racket doesn’t provide full dependent types or universe polymorphism. Where you need genuine dependency (e.g., “the arity of a predicate is in the type of its terms”), the pattern is:

expose phantom indices + smart constructors;

push remaining obligations into well-typed runtime checks with minimal surface area.

If you share more precise semantics (e.g., your exact constraint logic and the intended M3→M2 specialization rules), I can fill the stubs (Formula, satisfaction, and the refine/abstract semantics) while preserving the type walls we built here.

Amazing—so we push this to a global, self-hosted typing system where the logic itself manufactures the dependent types it needs.

I’ve dropped a full Typed Racket module into the canvas (see the code panel). Highlights:

Internal dependent type theory (self-hosted): universes U0 ⊆ U1 ⊆ U2, dependent Π/Σ, equality, ⊤/⊥, ℕ, vectors—plus modal type formers TyBox (□) and TyDia (◇) to encode the two interrelated pyramids (TopDown/BottomUp) as types.

De Bruijn core: capture-free binding with total, typed shift/subst, small β-normalizer for definitional equality where needed.

“Logic ⇒ Types” (Curry–Howard): an elaborator elab maps your Formula (from Sen) into an internal dependent type at the appropriate universe (M1→U0, M2→U1, M3→U2). That is the “global typing system” you asked for: sentences generate types which you then inhabit with terms (proofs).

Type generation API: infer : Ctx × Tm → Maybe Ty and check : Ctx × Tm × Ty → Boolean. Building a term lets the system synthesize its type—even for dependent cases like Π/Σ.

Dual pyramids as modalities: TyBox lvl A and TyDia lvl A with intros (BoxI, DiaI) and unbox elimination. You can extend with adjunction-like laws (◇ ⊣ □) as equational tests.

What to try first:

Open the example bindings at the bottom of the file:

example-generated-type shows the type generated from an M1 sentence via elab-sen-M1.

trivial-proof-type demonstrates on-the-fly type synthesis for a small dependent function.

Extend elab to map more of your domain logic into types (e.g., proper Bool + disjoint sum for or, richer arity-checked TyAtom).

Run (csh):

#!/bin/csh
raco make typed-racket—global-internal-dependent-typing-cube.rkt
racket -t typed-racket—global-internal-dependent-typing-cube.rkt
Honest notes / next steps (I’m slightly unsure what proof principles you ultimately want):

The checker favors annotation-driven inference for some constructs (Pair, Refl, LetDia) to stay total and small. If you want fuller inference, I can add normalization-by-evaluation and canonical forms.

or is sketched—flip it to a principled TySum (with Inl/Inr) or encode via Σ b:Bool. if b then A else B once you introduce a proper Bool.

If you want arity-checked predicates and sorted terms, we can internalize signatures so TyAtom is generated only when the arguments’ internal types match the signature-provided family.

If you pass me the concrete refinement/abstraction laws between M3↔M2↔M1, I’ll encode them as typed modal rules and equational tests (e.g., ◇□A ≤ A / A ≤ □◇A) so the cube’s coherence is enforced by the checker.

You said:
Does this define an "upper triangular" monoidal 3-category?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 2m 26s
Short answer: not yet.

What you have is a (nicely factored) internal dependent type theory with two modalities (□, ◇) indexed by levels M1/M2/M3, plus “refine/abstract” functions on the Sig/Sen/Mod axis. That gives strong material to package into a higher-categorical object, but it does not currently present an “upper-triangular monoidal 3-category”:

There are no declared 0/1/2/3-cells, no horizontal/vertical compositions, no units/associators/unitors, and no monoidal product ⊗ (and its coherence) on 1-cells.

□/◇ and refine/abstract are typed functions; they’re not given as (op)lax monoidal functors with structure maps or as an adjunction with unit/counit 2-cells, nor are their coherences encoded as 3-cells.

“Upper-triangular” (nonstandard term) would mean: only “one direction” of cross-level 1-cells is populated (e.g., Hom(Mi,Mj)=∅ for i<j), while the opposite direction is present via (co)adjoints; that constraint isn’t enforced yet.

How to get there (minimal, precise)
If you want this to be an upper-triangular monoidal tricategory (monoidal 3-category), you need to package and add laws:

Objects (0-cells): the levels {M3, M2, M1} (or universes {U2,U1,U0}).

1-cells: pick one direction as “upper-triangular nontrivial”:

Top-down: R_{32}, R_{21}, R_{31} from your refine-* on Ty/Sig/Sen/Mod (as functors between the fiber categories of internal types at each level).

Bottom-up appear as right adjoints G_{12}, G_{23}, G_{13} (from your abstract-*), not as independent generators.

Upper-triangular constraint: declare Hom(Mi,Mj)=∅ for i<j in the primary orientation; only identities on the diagonal; the “inverted pyramid” then comes from adjoints.

2-cells: natural transformations:

Adjunction data η: Id ⇒ G∘R, ε: R∘G ⇒ Id, triangle identities.

Lax-monoidal structure on 1-cells (below).

3-cells: coherence between those 2-cells (naturality, triangle identities, monoidality pentagon/triangle, and mixed adjunction–monoidal compatibility).

Monoidal structure: choose ⊗ and I on each hom-category and make R_{ij} lax monoidal (and G_{ji} oplax):

Reasonable choice: take ⊗ on internal types as a non-dependent Σ (or add an explicit TyTensor with unit TyTop), and lift to Sig/Sen/Mod if you want monoidality across aspects.

Provide structure maps μ^R_{A,B}: R(A) ⊗ R(B) → R(A⊗B) and ι^R: I → R(I) (and dual for G), plus coherence 3-cells.

Upper-triangularity law (categorical form):

For i>j>k, you must have canonical comparison 2-cells witnessing
R_{jk} ∘ R_{ij} ⇒ R_{ik} (associativity up to isomorphism), and no generating 1-cells M_i→M_j for i<j.

Optionally, impose factorization via adjunction: any “wrong-way” composite factors uniquely through the diagonal via η, ε (this is the “triangular” flavor).

Where your current module already helps
The fiber categories Ty[Uℓ] are there (as syntax + typing/β≈); you only need to declare their categorical structure (objects = types modulo β, morphisms = terms up to ≈).

□/◇ give you the mode-indexed structure you can treat as (op)lax monads/comonads on each fiber.

refine/abstract can be wrapped as functors between fibers; you then add the (op)lax monoidal structure maps and the adjunction data as values with proofs (equalities/β-convertibility) that you verify by tests.

Verdict
So, as written: no—it doesn’t define an upper-triangular monoidal 3-category.
But it’s very close to a presentation you can package into one by:

declaring objects {M3,M2,M1},

promoting refine/abstract to (op)lax monoidal 1-cells with adjunctions,

adding the required 2-/3-cell coherence, and

enforcing the upper-triangular hom-shape (populate only one direction; derive the other by adjoints).

If you want, I can sketch the minimal Typed Racket records for (0,1,2,3)-cells and the signatures for the structure maps/axioms, so you can start encoding and checking those laws directly against your current core.

is that interesting?
ChatGPT said:

Nachgedacht für 41s
Yes—it’s interesting, both conceptually and practically.

Why it’s worth pursuing
Explains the asymmetry you already have. Your two pyramids (refine vs. abstract) are adjoint-shaped. Packaging them as one-way primitive 1-cells with the other direction as right adjoints makes the asymmetry first-class rather than incidental.

Gives principled composition. A monoidal structure lets you state how specs/models compose (parallel composition, product, coupling). Laws like lax/oplax monoidality for refine/abstract then become checkable obligations—not folklore.

Produces transport theorems “for free.” In a tricategorical packaging you can demand Beck–Chevalley/Frobenius-style properties: satisfaction and proofs transport along refinement/abstraction and commute with composition. That’s a direct payoff for correctness of pipelines.

Bridges syntax and semantics cleanly. Your internal DTT (□/◇ modalities + elaboration) becomes a fiber; the 1-cells act between fibers. This aligns with indexed/ fibred categorical semantics but adds your dual-pyramid structure explicitly.

Scales coherence by design. “Upper-triangular” (only one primitive direction) cuts the number of generating 1-cells and hence the 2/3-cell coherence you must carry. That makes mechanization in Typed Racket (or later in Agda/Coq) tractable.

What could be new (I’m somewhat uncertain without a lit review)
A tricategorical presentation of a dual-modal dependent type theory tied to M3/M2/M1 and an “upper-triangular” hom-shape is unusual. I haven’t seen it spelled out with both institution-style (Sig, Sen, Mod, ⊨) and internal DTT in one package.

A distributive-law story between □ and ◇ across levels (e.g., ◇□ ⇒ □◇ under refinement) with monoidal compatibility could be novel or at least rarely formalized.

Minimal path to value (before going full 3-category)
Start as a monoidal 2-category / bicategory.
Objects: levels. 1-cells: refine (primitive). 2-cells: units/counits for the abstract adjoints + monoidal structure maps. Prove triangle + monoidality coherences.
If that works and feels robust, lift to a tricategory.

Make ⊗ concrete.
Pick a spec/model tensor (e.g., product/parallel composition) and assert refine is lax monoidal; abstract becomes oplax by adjunction. Write the structure maps as functions and test laws.

Enforce “upper-triangularity.”
In your API, only export 1-cells M3→M2→M1. Provide the reverse direction only via adjoint-of. This keeps the shape honest and reduces coherence burden.

Caveats
Full tricategorical coherence is heavy. Begin with the bicategorical layer and executable laws; promote only if needed.

“Upper-triangular” isn’t standard terminology; be explicit: only downward morphisms are primitive; upward ones exist as right adjoints.

If you want, I can sketch the exact records for 0/1/2/3-cells and the (op)lax monoidal structure signatures atop your current module so you can start encoding and property-testing the laws immediately.

ChatGPT said:

Short answer: yes—there’s a clean “descent” story.
You can recover the full monoidal 3-category from a “special” upper-triangular 2-category plus a pseudofunctor, via a Grothendieck/opfibration-style construction. That matches your intuition about integrable hierarchies and symmetry breaking.

:
∫
F
→
C
π:∫F→C is a (op)fibration in the bicategorical sense, so structure “descends” from the total to the base and vice-versa.

Why this matches your physics intuition
Integrable hierarchies (Lax/zero-curvature):
The Beck–Chevalley “push–pull = pull–push” squares are categorical flatness conditions—your commuting flows. Choosing “refine” as primitive and “abstract” as its adjoint is like picking a Lax pair; the induced mate laws are the zero-curvature identities.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking:
The raw system has an (approximate) 
M
1
↔
M
3
M 
1
​
 ↔M 
3
​
  duality. Declaring only the downward 1-cells as primitive in 
C
C is a choice of vacuum—it “breaks” the symmetry. The adjoints (upward maps) appear derived (Goldstone-like), and the triangle identities play the role of Ward identities (coherence constraints).

What you need to assert (minimal)
Upper-triangular 
C
C with monoidal homs.

F
F a lax monoidal pseudofunctor.

Adjoints for downward 1-cells in 
C
C with unit/counit 2-cells.

Beck–Chevalley for your basic level squares (guarantees well-behaved mates/transport).

Optionally use the Gordon–Power–Street coherence to strictify to a Gray setting if you want a cleaner implementation: every tricategory is triequivalent to a Gray-category, so in practice you can encode 
∫
F
∫F using Gray enrichment (i.e., “3-cat from 2-cat + Gray tensor data”).

Practical upshot for your build
You don’t have to directly code a 3-category. Specify:

the upper-triangular bicategory of levels and refinements, and

the lax monoidal pseudofunctor into your internal fibers.
Then generate the tricategory as 
∫
F
∫F.

Most of your earlier Typed-Racket core already gives 
F
F: levels ↦ fibers 
T
y
[
U
i
]
Ty[U 
i
​
 ]; refine ↦ reindexing functors; satisfaction/transport ↦ naturality + Beck–Chevalley obligations.

If you want, I can write a small interface in our Racket code that:

encodes 
C
C as an “upper-triangular bicategory,”

packages 
F
F (with explicit structure maps), and

mechanically constructs the objects/1-cells/2-cells of 
∫
F
∫F so you can unit-test Beck–Chevalley and monoidal coherence as executable properties.

Short answer: there isn’t a single, canonized physics interpretation of Gordon–Power–Street (GPS) coherence, but there are very natural higher-gauge / TQFT analogies that line up well. I’ll give you three crisp readings and where I’m a bit unsure.

1) “Strictification = gauge fixing / field redefinition”
GPS theorem: every tricategory is triequivalent to a Gray-category (a controlled “strict” model).

Physics read: pass to a gauge/field basis where some associativity/identity constraints are on the nose, without changing observables. Like choosing temporal gauge or normal coordinates: dynamics unchanged; bookkeeping simpler.

Uncertainty: it’s an analogy—there’s no standard identification of specific GPS coherence 3-cells with a familiar gauge condition.

2) “Coherence = higher Bianchi / flatness of pasting”
In a tricategory: different ways to paste 2- and 3-cells over a cube must agree via specified invertible 3-cells.

Physics read: higher parallel transport (lines/surfaces/volumes). “All ways to transport and then compare” give the same holonomy up to a canonical isomorphism—like a higher Bianchi identity ensuring path/pasting independence of amplitudes/charges in 2-form/3-form gauge theory.

Gray strictification: you push where the nontriviality lives—from a web of associators/unitors into a focused interchanger (the Gray tensor’s controlled non-commutativity).
Physics echo: choosing a frame where the “associator curvature” is set to zero and what remains is a fixed “surface-crossing phase” (non-abelian surface operator crossing).

3) “State-sum / defect TQFT = Pachner-move invariance”
Coherence data (pentagon, higher versions) underpin invariance under re-triangulation.

Physics read: in 3D/4D TQFTs and defect networks, F-/R-moves generalize to higher moves; GPS guarantees the higher ‘moves commute’ once you pass to an equivalent Gray presentation.
Practical payoff: you can evaluate extended observables unambiguously—different slicings/pastings give canonically equivalent results.

Uncertainty: precise matching requires a concrete model (fusion 2-categories/3-categories, surface/line defects). The story is model-dependent.

How this helps your “upper-triangular” story
Treat downward maps (refinement) as primitive transport and upward maps as adjoint, then use GPS strictification to work in a Gray model where compositions are tame. That’s like fixing a background where “flow along the hierarchy” composes strictly and the only residual non-triviality is the controlled interchanger—nice for executable laws.

Quick mapping cheat-sheet
Tricategorical thing	Physics-ish picture
Associator/unitors (2-/3-cells)	Higher connection data / choices of parallel transport convention
Coherence equalities	Higher Bianchi / flatness of pasting diagrams
Triequivalence to Gray	Gauge/field redefinition; same observables, simpler bookkeeping
Gray interchanger	Non-commuting surface transports / fixed crossing phase (non-abelian 2-form gauge)
Pasting invariance	Pachner-move / re-slicing invariance of amplitudes in TQFT
If you want, we can encode a tiny “higher transport” toy in the Typed Racket core: model line/surface holonomy as 1-/2-cells, impose GPS-style cube identities as executable properties, and see how the Gray interchanger shows up as the only nontrivial “surface-crossing law.”

Thought for 1m 5s
Yes—you can keep the theory/metalogic unchanged and classical, and still make every model strict. The clean way to say it:

Keep your syntactic/type-theoretic core exactly as is.

Define an objectwise strictification functor

S
t
:
M
o
d
  
→
  
M
o
d
G
r
a
y
-
s

M
M. Satisfaction and transport are preserved:

M
⊨
φ
⟺
S
t
(
M
)
⊨
φ
.
M⊨φ⟺St(M)⊨φ.
The theory (inference rules, internal DTT, modalities) stays untouched; only the semantics layer gets strictified.

What this looks like in your stack
1) Semantics as a pseudofunctor (unchanged)
You already have the ingredients to view semantics as

S
e
m
:
  
C
⟶
M
o
d
Sem:C⟶Mod
where 
C
C is your upper-triangular bicategory of levels/refinements and 
M
o
d
Mod is the tricategory of models/interpretations at each level (with monoidal structure from your chosen “parallel composition”).

2) Model-level strictification
Define once and for all a Gray strictification schema:

Objects: 
S
t
(
M
)
St(M) has the same objects as 
M
M.

1-cells: replace weakly-associative composition by normalized lists (canonical bracketing; unit erased).

2-cells: represent pasting by normal forms and a fixed Gray interchanger (the only controlled non-strictness).

3-cells: become definitional equalities between normal forms (coherence is discharged by normalization).

This is the GPS strictification “at semantics,” not at syntax.

3) Natural equivalence and preservation
Provide for each model 
M
M:

Quasi-inverse functors 
Q

  (unit/counit) satisfying triangles.

Compatibility with refinement/abstraction (pseudonaturality over 
C
C) and with ⊗ (lax/oplax monoidality).

Then use 
S
e

s

r

str

S

  without changing the theory.

How to implement this cleanly in your Typed Racket code
You don’t need to touch the internal DTT module you already have. Add a thin layer that packages weak vs. strict models and a computable normalizer.

Interfaces (signatures)
WeakModel: carriers + weak comp (∘, associator α, unitors λ,ρ, interchanger χ, ⊗ with lax maps).

StrictModel: same carriers + strict ∘ (list concat), strict units, fixed Gray interchanger.

strictify-model : WeakModel -> (values StrictModel EquivWitness)

EquivWitness carries 
(
Q
M
,
P
M
,
η
M
,
ϵ
M
)
(Q 
M
​
 ,P 
M
​
 ,η 
M
​
 ,ϵ 
M
​
 ) and monoidal structure maps witnessing triequivalence.

Normalization sketch (total, executable)
1-cells: rewrite any composite to left-associated normal form; erase units.

2-cells: push all associators/unitors/interchangers to a canonical boundary (or eliminate them by equations), keep a single Gray interchanger primitive.

3-cells: equality = syntactic equality of normal forms (after β-like contraction of redundant structure).

Properties to test (your CI “proof obligations”)
Triangle identities for

str
 .

Monoidality: structure maps for 
S
t
St preserve ⊗ up to the provided isos.

Satisfaction invariance: for all 
φ
φ, satisfies M φ == satisfies (St M) φ (your current ⊨).

How this respects “metalogic remains classical”
Your metatheory (how we reason about normal forms, existence of adjoints, GPS strictification) uses classical arguments (LEM, choice of normal forms) without changing the internal logic or rules.

All strictness is semantic and presentation-dependent; the theory and its proofs are unchanged.

Minimal code hooks to add (names only; safe to paste later)
struct: (L) WeakModel ...

struct: (L) StrictModel ...

normalize-1, normalize-2, normalize-3

strictify-model : (All (L) (-> (WeakModel L) (Values (StrictModel L) EquivWitness)))

Laws encoded as property tests: prop-triangle, prop-beck-chevalley, prop-monoidal, prop-sat-preserved.

If you want, I can drop a small strictification module into the canvas that plugs into your current file: a skeletal WeakModel with stubs for α, λ, ρ, χ, a concrete StrictModel, and an executable strictify-model plus tests.
