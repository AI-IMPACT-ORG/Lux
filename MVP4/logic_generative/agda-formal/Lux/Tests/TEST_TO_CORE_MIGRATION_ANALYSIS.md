# CLEAN Logic System - Test-to-Core Migration Analysis

## üîç **ANALYSIS: What Should Be Migrated from Tests to Core**

### **üéØ CRITICAL FINDINGS**

After analyzing the test suite, I've identified several **fundamental mathematical operations and structures** that are currently only referenced in tests but should be **core functionality** in the Agda presentation of the CLEAN logic system.

## **üìä MIGRATION PRIORITY MATRIX**

### **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Essential Core Operations**

#### **1. Triality Operations (V10 Core)**
**Current Status**: Only referenced in tests, not implemented in core
**Should Be Core Because**: These are fundamental mathematical operations

**Operations to Migrate:**
- **Projectors**: `P(P(x)) = P(x)` - idempotent projection operations
- **Boundary Sum**: `œÅ(t) = [L]t ‚äï_B [R]t` - reconstitution operation
- **Bulk Equals Boundaries**: `ŒΩ_L(t) = ŒΩ_L(œÅ(t)), ŒΩ_R(t) = ŒΩ_R(œÅ(t))`
- **Triality Functors**: `T_L, T_R, T_B` - fundamental functors
- **Residual Properties**: Core mathematical properties
- **Bulk Two Boundaries**: `Bulk = Two Boundaries` theorem

#### **2. Moduli System Operations (V10 Core)**
**Current Status**: Only referenced in tests, not implemented in core
**Should Be Core Because**: These are essential for parametric normal forms

**Operations to Migrate:**
- **Moduli System**: `Œº_L, Œ∏_L, Œº_R, Œ∏_R` - moduli operations
- **Central Scalars**: `z, zÃÑ` - extended central scalars
- **Parametric Normal Forms**: `NF, NF^B` - normal form operations
- **Header Endomorphisms**: `f_Œ∏:‚Ñ§‚Üí‚Ñ§, g_Œº:‚Ñ§‚Üí‚Ñ§` - header operations
- **Modulated Projectors**: `[Œº,Œ∏](t)` - modulated projection
- **Auxiliary Transporter**: `M_{Œîk,Œîm_z,Œîm_{zÃÑ}}(t)` - transport operations

#### **3. Advanced Mathematical Operations**

**Operations to Migrate:**
- **Guarded Negation**: `¬¨^g(x) := g‚äñ_L x` - local negation
- **NAND Operations**: `NAND(x,y) := ¬¨^g(x ‚äó_L y)` - local NAND
- **gn-and, gn-or, gn-xor**: Guarded logical operations

#### **5. Domain Port Operations (V10 CLASS)**

## **üìã MIGRATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Core Mathematical Operations**
1. **Migrate Triality Operations** from `V10Core/TrialityOperations.agda` tests

### **Phase 3: Truth Theorems**
1. **Migrate Truth Theorems** from `TruthTheorems/CoreTheorems.agda` tests
2. **Integrate Mathematical Consistency** into core
3. **Integrate Diagonal Lemma** into core

## **üéØ BENEFITS OF MIGRATION**

### **1. Mathematical Completeness**
- **Core operations** become first-class citizens in the logic
- **Mathematical rigor** is maintained at the core level
- **Specification compliance** is ensured at the core level

### **2. Architectural Integrity**
- **Onion architecture** is properly implemented
- **Core functionality** is separated from test infrastructure
- **Dependency management** is improved

### **3. Test Quality**
- **Tests become validation** of core operations rather than definitions
- **Test coverage** becomes more meaningful
- **Test maintenance** becomes easier

## **üöÄ RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **1. Create Core Triality Operations Module**
- Extract projector operations from tests
- Implement boundary sum and reconstitution

- Implement header endomorphisms

### **3. Update Core Kernel**

## **üéâ CONCLUSION**

**The test suite reveals that significant mathematical operations are currently only referenced in tests but should be core functionality.**

**Priority Migration:**
1. **Triality Operations** (projectors, boundary sum, functors)
2. **Moduli System** (parametric normal forms, header operations)
3. **Advanced Operations** (cumulants, Œî-operators, Green's functions)
4. **Guarded Negation** (local negation, NAND operations)
5. **Domain Ports** (PSDM, path integrals, partition functions)
6. **Truth Theorems** (Mathematical consistency, diagonal properties)

**This migration will transform the CLEAN logic system from a test-driven architecture to a mathematically complete core architecture with comprehensive test validation.**
