(* Lux Formal Logic Library - Complete Isabelle Session Definitions *)
(* ============================================================================ *)
(* 
 * This file defines the complete Isabelle sessions for the Lux formal logic library.
 * Each session corresponds to a layer in the three-tier architecture plus extensions:
 * 
 * - Lux_Axioms: Mathematical foundations (A0-A7 axioms, semirings, observers)
 * - Lux_Core: Definitional layer (triality, reconstitution, generating functional)  
 * - Lux_Constructive: Constructive extensions (residuals, Karoubi split)
 * - Lux_Class: Application layer (guarded negation, PSDM, dependent types)
 * - Lux_Consistency: Mathematical consistency decisions
 * - Lux_Ports: Domain ports (Turing machines, Lambda calculus, QFT)
 * - Lux_Tests: Comprehensive test suite
 * - Lux_Theorems: Extracted theorems and proofs
 * - Lux_API: Complete library API fa√ßade
 * - Lux_Complete: Full library with all components
 * 
 * Sessions are designed for AI-powered software development with stable APIs.
