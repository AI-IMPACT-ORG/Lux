## Usage

### Accessing Theorems
```isabelle
theory MyTheory
  imports "Lux/Theorems/Extracted_Theorems"
begin

(* Access to all extracted theorems and proofs *)

lemma my_theorem: "my_property"
  by (simp add: extracted_theorem)

end
```

### Using Proof Strategies
```isabelle
theory MyProofTheory
  imports "Lux/Theorems/Extracted_Theorems"
begin

(* Use extracted proof strategies *)

lemma my_proof: "my_property"
  using extracted_proof_strategy by auto

end
```

### Theorem Dependencies
```isabelle
theory MyDependencyTheory
  imports "Lux/Theorems/Extracted_Theorems"
begin

(* Access theorem dependencies *)

lemma my_dependent_theorem: "my_property"
  using extracted_dependency by auto

end
```

## Mathematical Principles
