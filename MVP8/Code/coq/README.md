## Key Mathematical Concepts

### Core Structures
- **Four Semirings**: L, R, Core (commutative), B (Frobenius algebra)
- **Observer/Embedding Maps**: `ι_L`, `ι_R`, `ι_Core`, `ν_L`, `ν_R`
- **Central Units**: `φ`, `z`, `z̄`, `Λ` (derived from z and z̄)
- **Braiding Operations**: `ad_i` with Yang-Baxter relations

### Advanced Features
- **Exponential/Logarithmic Structure**: `dec`/`rec` with integer headers
- **Normal Forms**: Header/core NF and B-valued NF
- **Triality**: Typed conjugations and triality functors
- **Renormalization**: Regulator schemes and counterterm identities
- **Domain Ports**: Boolean, λ-calculus, Info-flow, and QFT implementations

## Semantic Dependency Organization

The library uses a semantic organization of external dependencies, mapping them to appropriate semirings:

### **Core Semiring → ZArith**
- **Purpose**: Integer arithmetic for header operations and core mathematical computations
- **Usage**: Header operations (k, mz, mbar), mathematical precision, core computations
- **Key Operations**: `Z.add`, `Z.sub`, `Z.mul`, `Z.abs`, `Z.of_nat`, `Z.to_nat`

### **L Semiring → Init.Nat**
- **Purpose**: Natural numbers for indexing, counting, and L-semiring operations
- **Usage**: Indexing in Feynman path integrals, counting steps, discrete operations
- **Key Operations**: `nat` type, `S`, `O` constructors, `Nat.add`, `Nat.mul`

### **R Semiring → Bool**
- **Purpose**: Boolean logic for decision-making, control flow, and R-semiring operations
- **Usage**: Conditional operations, control flow, branching, conditional execution
- **Key Operations**: `bool` type, `true`, `false`, `andb`, `orb`, `negb`

### **B Semiring → List**
- **Purpose**: Lists for Feynman path integrals and complex structures
- **Usage**: Feynman path integrals, complex data structures, sequences
- **Key Operations**: `list` type, `nil`, `cons`, `List.fold_left`, `List.map`

## Renormalization Conditions

The semantic mapping acts as **renormalization conditions** for porting the Lux framework to Coq:

### **Scheme Independence**
Same mathematical operations produce same results regardless of computational representation.

### **Header-Only Operations**
Operations act only on headers, leaving core mathematical structure unchanged.

### **Port Coherence**
Different representations produce same observable results.

### **Moduli-Regularised Gauge**
All operations work in the moduli-regularised gauge where semiring structure provides renormalization framework.

### **Scheme Change Transporters**
Conversion functions preserve mathematical structure when moving between representations.

## Abstractions and Parameterization

The library has been abstracted to remove shortcuts and concrete implementations:

### **Parameterized Components**
- **Feynman Path Integrals**: Configurable truncation order instead of hardcoded values
- **Normal Form Parameters**: Parameterized default values instead of hardcoded zeros
- **Moduli Space Parameters**: Configurable default values for different normalization schemes

### **Concrete Implementations Retained**
- **Domain Ports**: Concrete implementations of specific domains (Boolean, Lambda, InfoFlow, QFT)
- **Mathematical Structures**: Specific implementations (Wilson recursion, Zpower_pos, HistoryStep records)
- **Identity Elements**: Mathematical identity elements appropriately hardcoded

## Library Optimizations

The library has undergone several optimization passes to create a more coherent and consistent foundational logic:

### **Pareto-Optimal File Organization**
- **Consolidated Redundant Files**: Merged small utility files and domain ports
- **Eliminated Code Bubbles**: Removed unused modules (AdvancedAlgebra, ConsolidatedImports, DomainPortTemplate, ParameterTemplates)
- **Streamlined Structure**: Reduced from 27 to 23 files while maintaining all functionality

### **Mathematical Consistency Enhancements**
- **Enhanced Signature**: Added mathematical foundation axioms (non-triviality, homomorphism consistency)
- **Improved Observer Operations**: Added injectivity lemmas and consistency proofs
- **Normal Form Integration**: Enhanced NF operations with RG coherence axioms
- **Semiring Template Unification**: Created reusable semiring templates with derived lemmas

### **Mathematical Elegance Integration**
- **Signature Unification**: Using templates for semiring definitions
- **Module Instantiation Consolidation**: Helper modules to reduce boilerplate
- **Proof Optimization**: Completed previously admitted proofs
- **Parameter Streamlining**: Consolidated common parameter patterns

### **Dependency Management**
- **Semantic Organization**: Mapped external dependencies to appropriate semirings
- **Centralized Imports**: Consolidated standard library imports
- **Reduced External Dependencies**: Pareto-optimal reduction while maintaining functionality
